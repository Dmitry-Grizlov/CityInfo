# CityInfo

Simple MVC web application providing information about the location. It includes weater forecats, recent news, sights images of the place requested. 

P.S. This applications uses integrations, requiring api keys. I don`t publish my keys accoring to safety reasons, that is why for application to start at your local machine, you will need to provide your own api keys. Here is the list of websites where you can get them:
* [**IpGeoKey**](https://ipgeolocation.io)
* [**NewsKey**](http://mediastack.com)
* [**ImageKey**](https://api.unsplash.com)

When you get your keys put them in the appropriate fields of **appsettings.json** file and project will start.
